# Whitebox-NN
The attached interactive python notebook has the basic implementation of a whitebox neural network.
The data set used has almost 27000 unique images of 24 different classes (hand signs).
Inorder to reduce computational complexities the no of epochs involved has been limited to only 10.
The current MSE of the network is found closer to 0.04.
The notebook is yet to be optimised and changes are to be done.
